### User Info API Test
# This file contains HTTP requests for testing the User Info API endpoint.
# It demonstrates how to retrieve user information from a JWT token.

### Get User Information
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/user-info
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

### Response for successful user info retrieval:
# {
#   "status": "Success",
#   "message": "User info retrieved successfully",
#   "data": {
#     "userId": "user_id",
#     "email": "user[at]example.com",
#     "name": "User Name"
#   }
# }

### Response for invalid or expired token:
# {
#   "status": "Failure",
#   "message": "Unauthorized: Invalid or expired token",
#   "data": null
# }

### Notes:
# 1. Replace "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" with a valid JWT token obtained from the authentication endpoint
# 2. This endpoint extracts user information directly from the JWT token
# 3. No request body is required for this endpoint
# 4. The Authorization header is required to identify the user
# 5. This endpoint is useful for verifying that a token is valid and contains the expected user information
